# Smart-Attendance-System-using-Computer-Vision

An AI-powered attendance system using face recognition. The system trains on student images, detects and recognizes faces in group photos, marks attendance, and provides a clean frontend interface for user interaction.

---

## üß† Key Features

- Face detection and recognition using `face_recognition` and `OpenCV`.
- Frontend interface for uploading group images and viewing attendance.
- Automatic attendance marking based on face matches.
- Attendance data export to Excel (`.xlsx`) using Pandas.
- User-friendly design for educators and administrators.
- Batch image training and support for multiple sessions.

## üìå Problem Statement

Manual attendance is slow, error-prone, and inefficient. This system automates attendance by analyzing a group photo of students, recognizing known faces, and recording attendance without manual input.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Build a computer vision system for face-based student recognition.
- Implement a frontend to allow users to:
  - Upload group images
  - View recognized faces
  - Download attendance reports
- Export attendance to Excel format with timestamps.
- Achieve accurate detection under varying lighting and angles.
- Allow easy retraining or updating of the student dataset.
